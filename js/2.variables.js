alert(uzername) //prints value of the variable "uzername" as a pop up notification

console.log(uzername);//prints the value of the variable in the browser's console and can only be seen if the console window is opened in the developer's option in the browser. like in google chrome, use the inspect option and then find the console window to display result.
